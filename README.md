### Key Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with fields for name, description, tag, and status. Every task has a unique ID for consistent lookup.
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by tags and status using dropdowns.
- **Custom Tags**: Add and delete tags for personalized task organization.
- **Task Display**: A scrollable task list that dynamically loads tasks from ZODB, highlighting the top 3 tasks based on their approaching deadlines.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track the progress of tasks via a progress bar and a detailed task summary.
- **Data Visualization**: An interactive pie chart visualizes task distribution by status, dynamically updated in real-time.

### Use Cases

- **Personal Organization**: Plan and organize daily tasks with custom tags and progress tracking.
- **Work Management**: Filter and prioritize tasks by deadline and status.
- **Academic Planning**: Track homework, exams, and study schedules.

### Libraries Used

- **CustomTkinter**: A modern and easy-to-use library for creating graphical user interfaces in Python.
- **ZODB**: A lightweight object-oriented database used for task storage.
- **Matplotlib**: A library used for creating data visualizations, such as pie charts, to display task distributions.
- **datetime**: Python's standard library for handling date-related tasks, especially for deadline management.
